Description: Helper functions provide an accurate imputation algorithm for reconstructing the missing segment in a multi-variate data streams. Inspired by single-shot learning, it reconstructs the missing segment by identifying the first similar segment in the stream. Nevertheless, there should be one column of data available, i.e. a constraint column. The values of columns can be characters (A, B, C, etc.). The result of the imputed dataset will be returned a .csv file. For more details see Reza Rawassizadeh (2019) <doi:10.1109/TKDE.2019.2914653>.
